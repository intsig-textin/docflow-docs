title: "Response JSON Structure Description"
---

<Tip>
  Docflow file upload is an asynchronous interface.\
  When the interface call is successful, it returns result identifiers (`batch_number` and `file ID`) for subsequent result retrieval.
</Tip>

After a successful upload interface request, the response will be returned in JSON format according to the following structure:

```json expandable
{
   "code":200,
   "msg":"成功",
   "result":{
      "batch_number":"1955840540571376304",
      "files":[
         {
            "id":"1955840505753140508",
            "name":"企业信用报告.pdf",
            "format":"pdf"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Important Field Description

- `batch_number`: File batch number. Can be associated with multiple files within the same batch.
- `files[].id`: File ID for this upload.

Both `batch_number` and `files[].id` can be used as query conditions for subsequent result retrieval.
